# Guitar Notes
Bart Massey 2022

These guitar notes should be a good test for an instrument
tuner.

* `guitar-a2.wav`: The open A string (roughly 110Hz A[2]).
* `guitar-a3.wav`: The G string fretted to A (roughly 220Hz A[3]).
* `guitar-a4.wav`: The high E string fretted to A (roughly 440Hz A[4]).

The guitar is not in great tune.  Also, the
highest-amplitude string frequency may correspond to some
harmonic or subharmonic of the intended frequency.
